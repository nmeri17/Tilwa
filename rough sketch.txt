->createQueryBuilder()

->select('u')->from(User::class, 'u')

->where('u.email = ?1')->setParameter(1, $reqData['email']) // this should go in "good to know"

route caching
	- all the routes should pass through regexForm and get saved with the result under a trie the way they were defined. The aim is to skip this replacement phase during runtime
	- only needed if you're using a lot of dynamic routes

try to deploy on azure

When you find a way of identifying orm models, revisit NoSqlLogic->setup

when cacheManager is integrated:
	- refactor its usage wherever it appears in respect to accessing nested objects; tags etc
	- is the override pattern we're using good or can it be updated while in the cache?

work needed on updateReactor

what container is used to hydrate handler method on the queued job?

on flow hit, upload the rest into the shared space for all users insted of simply discarding it

AssignListeners::class

we need a cli command for copying laravel config/migrations files from the library locations to dev land i.e. so config can lift the files (from the hard-coded "config" folder)


##controllers and services

Bar:
	- app level service entry into repositories
	- orm in services
Extract rejection logic into a class and inject that into both service wrapper and executable classes. then implement an interface that informs these parents to run x whenever such interface is met
	prefersServices, servicePreferenceManager

Revisit NoSqlLogic for implementing the factory pattern

Refactor RouteCollection->getPatterns() to work with a IRouteCollection interface we reflect and exclude methods not matching the interface's methods

Bonus: add auth services (email verification, password recovery) dev can inject in their controllers

Pending:
	- exception renderer

we have authorization and testing as major components left
