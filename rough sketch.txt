install eloquent

open an avenue for swapping in as a driver (see methods on the client facing bootstrap class)

use it to derive an authenticated user

move over to the reconstructing the controller actions

breakdown the routes into their various types

open another avenue for swapping in template engine as a driver. The driver class will contain an action method that receives the template, file and data as arguments

in the front controller
	correctly obtain response
	wire in/pull out the active request for this/a route

in the request manager
	changeDestination should
		access active request

		delegate validation and validation failure to it // this->failedValidation

		set validation data on the request/route object

move crud actions into the request manager class, mapping route pattern to action method. route "resources" pair these in the manager

refactor template engine->assignFile to accept view name rather than only working with router. then edit all instances where it was initialized
