work needed on updateReactor

what container is used to hydrate handler method on the queued job?

##controllers and services

Bar:
	- app level service entry into repositories
	- orm in services
Extract rejection logic into a class and inject that into both service wrapper and executable classes. then implement an interface that informs these parents to run x whenever such interface is met

Refactor RouteCollection->getPatterns() to work with a IRouteCollection interface we reflect and exclude methods not matching the interface's methods

Pending:
	- exception renderer
	- testing

User-land test interface doesn't rely on the outer module assembly or index.php in order to access app core. testing bits wanna access that core from anywhere

We wanna add new columns on our database/model A for module A but don't wanna break the code in other modules reliant on model A.
