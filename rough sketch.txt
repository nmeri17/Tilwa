flesh out auth controller actions. Implement loginAs

flows

go back to route collection
	- emit _beforeExecute, _afterExecute for controller actions
	- the routeManager injecting models/controllers should'nt blanket find, but create dry objects for post/update routes (known from their handler :D)

install eloquent (requires a fork that doesn't use their container and event interfaces) and plates

->createQueryBuilder()

->select('u')->from(User::class, 'u')

->where('u.email = ?1')->setParameter(1, $reqData['email'])

route caching
	- all the routes should pass through regexForm and get saved with the result under a trie the way they were defined. The aim is to skip this replacement phase during runtime
	- only needed if you're using a lot of dynamic routes

this->_get(new ResponseType) // home route
->flow([...define keys to return])->linksTo([categoryPath, pathToMenuItems])
